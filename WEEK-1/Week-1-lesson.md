## 📚 Detailed Session Summary

### 🚀 API and Sentiment Analysis Demo

* Asabeneh demonstrated two applications he built:

  * A **sentiment analysis tool**, which analyzes text input and displays results through a **dynamic pie chart**.
  * A **cat breed API**, which provided structured data that can be accessed and displayed across platforms.
* He shared links to both applications in the chat for participants to explore.
